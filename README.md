### About

I was introduced to computing by a passionate educator in high school, and never looked back. A decade later, I am a seasoned full-stack web developer who've acquired a wide range of skills while carving people ideas in code. My professional ambitions lay in broadening my expertise with every groundbreaking technology I can get my hands on, without amateurism or spreading too thin.
